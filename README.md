# Berkley_Pacman_Projects

My implementation of the Berkeley Pacman Projects

+ Project 1: Search
+ Project 2: Multi-agent Search

Search: Implement depth-first, breadth-first, UCS, and A* search algorithms in order to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

Multi-Agent Search: Implement multiagent minimax, alpha-beta pruning minimax  and expectimax algorithms to play the clasical Pacman game, as well as designed evaluation functions.
